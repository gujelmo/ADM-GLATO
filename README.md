Hello,
you can check the notebook file HMW1_Guglielmo_Lato.ipynb for the solutions of the hackerrank Excercises.
I put in the file only the solved ones.

I'm not sure how to produce the PDF printout of the hackerrank page. I'm trying to upolad some sort of screenshot in the root of my REPO.

Bye
GL
