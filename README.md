# ADM-GLATO
Hello,
you can check the notebook file HMW1_Guglielmo_Lato.ipynb for the solutions of the hackerrank Excercises.
I put in the file only the solved ones.

I'm not sure how to produce the PDF printout of the hackerrank page. 
You can find the screenshots of the submissions of the hackerrank site into the folder HMW1 GLATO ADM


Bye
GL
